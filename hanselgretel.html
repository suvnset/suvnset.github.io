                            <p>Hansel vs. Gretel is a competitive board game inspired by escape rooms, where two players race to escape the Witch’s house first. Set in the world of the classic fairy tale, players must solve puzzles and face off in physical dexterity challenges to uncover clues and guess which mythical being is sealing the exit. If no one solves the mystery before reaching the final room, the winner is determined by the number of challenges they have won. Combining mental and physical gameplay, Hansel vs. Gretel offers a unique blend of strategy, competition, and storytelling.</p>
                            <h3>Key Features</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Escape Room Dynamic:</strong> Players must navigate the game board, using clues from physical challenges to guess the identity of the mythical being blocking their escape.</li>
                                <li><strong>Mythical Themes:</strong> A wide variety of mythical beings and scenarios keep gameplay fresh, while players engage in a strategic battle of wits.</li>
                                <li><strong>Physical Dexterity Challenges:</strong> The core mechanic involves fast-paced, physical mini-games that determine who earns clues to solve the game's central mystery.</li>
                                <li><strong>Replayability:</strong> Players can customize the experience by swapping out mythical beings, adjusting challenges, and expanding the narrative to other themes (e.g., superheroes, video game characters).</li>
								<li><strong>Engaging Dramatic Premise:</strong> The game’s story-driven premise is inspired by the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale, immersing players in a competitive yet familiar environment.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Design Process and Iteration:</h3>
							<p>Throughout development, we refined the game based on multiple rounds of playtesting. Early iterations revealed the importance of balancing physical dexterity with the puzzle-solving elements, leading to significant changes in challenge design and hint distribution. Feedback showed players enjoyed the thematic elements, but some challenges were initially too difficult or confusing. We adjusted gameplay to ensure the physical activities were accessible and the rules clear, while also rebalancing the hint system for a more even competition.</p>
							<h3>Development Team:</h3>
							<p>The project was developed by a small, focused team, including myself and three others from USC. Together, we divided responsibilities across gameplay mechanics, challenge design, and dramatic elements to ensure the game was cohesive and fun.</p>
							<h3>Development Role:</h3>
							<p>As a game designer, I was heavily involved in crafting the game mechanics, refining physical challenges, and balancing the hint system to maintain fair and engaging competition. I collaborated closely with my team, iterating on feedback from playtests to ensure a smooth and enjoyable player experience. I also contributed to creating the game's narrative premise and oversaw adjustments to ensure thematic consistency.</p>
							<p>Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to blend game design with physical interaction, as well as my understanding of playtesting and iterative development.</p>

                            <p>Scythe of Sidereal is an action-packed, wave-based combat game set in eerie, cursed locations. Players control Scylix, a mysterious exorcist with the ability to wield a scythe in both melee and ranged combat. The game unfolds over three intense waves, each more challenging than the last. Victory is rewarded with power-ups that carry over to subsequent battles, enhancing the player's abilities. The game's haunted settings include graveyards, haunted manors, and catacombs, with each location becoming more expansive as players progress through waves.</p>
							<p>Scylix, cloaked in a shroud of mystery and power, must eliminate demonic beings to achieve godhood. The gameplay emphasizes fast-paced combat, where strategic movement and relentless attacks are key to surviving the overwhelming hordes of enemies.</p>
							<h3>Key Features</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Dynamic Combat:</strong> Wield Scylix’s scythe as a versatile weapon—slashing through enemies at close range or launching it as a projectile for devastating long-range attacks.</li>
                                <li><strong>Progressive Difficulty:</strong> Each wave introduces stronger and more numerous enemies, pushing players to adapt and strategize on the fly.</li>
                                <li><strong>Haunted Environments:</strong> Battle through atmospheric and cursed locales like graveyards, haunted manors, and catacombs, each offering unique challenges.</li>
                                <li><strong>Power-Up System:</strong> After each successful wave, players can choose from various power-ups and items that persist through the rest of the game, offering a personalized playstyle.</li>
								<li><strong>Art & Audio Direction:</strong> In collaboration with sound designers from Berklee, the game features a cinematic, eerie soundtrack to enhance exploration, with upbeat combat music inspired by Luigi’s Mansion and Earthbound.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Technical Details</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Engine:</strong> Unity Universal 2D</li>
                                <li><strong>Language:</strong> C#</li>
                                <li><strong>Development Timeline:</strong> Vertical Slice, Alpha, Beta, Final Release (October - December)</li>
                                <li><strong>Platforms:</strong> TBD</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Development Team:</h3>
							<p>The project is developed by a small, focused team, including myself and another developer from USC, alongside talented sound designers from Berklee, who bring the haunted environments to life through a rich and immersive soundscape.</p>
							<h3>Development Role:</h3>
							<p>As a core developer, I implement the game's combat mechanics, enemy AI, and progression systems. I collaborate closely with my fellow USC developer on gameplay features and with Berklee sound designers to integrate audio that complements the game’s visual and interactive elements. Additionally, I help drive the iterative design process by gathering feedback from early playtests and fine-tuning the gameplay experience for balance and engagement.</p>
							<p>Through this project, I will have demonstrated my skills in 2D game development using Unity and C#, as well as my ability to collaborate effectively across disciplines to create a polished and immersive gaming experience.</p>
